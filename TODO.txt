1. Cooking directions are really inconsistent. How can I fix this? Try to brainstorm
or find a better API.
2. id 52905 -- chocolate souffle -- duplicate ingredients. Fix this "edge case"... i hate
this api.
3. 52992 and 52807 -- both use random \r\n\ in middle of sentences. Fix this "edge case" too.
4. Having this idea to make the hamburger a realistic looking hamburger (like the food)
on hover... bad idea??? If so, delete 'RealHamburgerSVG' from SVGs folder.
5. recipe page and recipe square both require a 'bold-text' class. Find to a way to share it
or get rid of it.
6. In ingredients listing, can I fix awkward wording, ex: 'Pinch Salt', 'Sprinkling Thyme', 
'For Frying Oil', 'To Taste Salt'. Can I replace all with
'A Pinch Of Salt'?
7. Inspect for semantic html. Am I just using divs when I could have used something else?
8. Check SASS for alphabetized properties.
9. Right now... I can add the same list item twice. I should not be able to do that.
Provide user with an error message, or disable add button, and prevent in back end too.
10. On sign up page... need to handle error if email is already in the system. Need to handle
that on the backend too.
11. Password reset?????

MISC EDGE CASES:
52954 - hot and sour soup - single STEP declaration at top.

52964 - smoked haddock kedgeree - LS symbol in directions. FIX ME!!!
53013 - numbered directions, but '1.' is missing from 1st step.
53056 - croatian lamb peka - looks wierd... not sure how to fix.
