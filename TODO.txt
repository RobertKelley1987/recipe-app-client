1. Cooking directions are really inconsistent. How can I fix this? Try to brainstorm
or find a better API.
2. id 52905 -- chocolate souffle -- duplicate ingredients. Fix this "edge case"... i hate
this api.
3. 52992 and 52807 -- both use random \r\n\ in middle of sentences. Fix this "edge case" too.
4. Having this idea to make the hamburger a realistic looking hamburger (like the food)
on hover... bad idea??? If so, delete 'RealHamburgerSVG' from SVGs folder.
5. recipe page and recipe square both require a 'bold-text' class. Find to a way to share it
or get rid of it.
6. In ingredients listing, can I fix awkward wording, ex: 'Pinch Salt', 'Sprinkling Thyme', 
'For Frying Oil', 'To Taste Salt'. Can I replace all with
'A Pinch Of Salt'?
7. Inspect for semantic html. Am I just using divs when I could have used something else?
8. Check SASS for alphabetized properties.

MISC EDGE CASES:
52954 - hot and sour soup - single STEP declaration at top.
52802 - fish pie - different numbering. '01., 02.'
52964 - smoked haddock kedgeree - LS symbol in directions. FIX ME!!!
53013 - numbered directions, but '1.' is missing from 1st step.
53056 - croatian lamb peka - looks wierd... not sure how to fix.
