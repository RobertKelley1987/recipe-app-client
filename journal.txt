7/4

real issues with the 'click outside to close' pattern I normally use.
event listener kept loading before element was actually shown on screen.
Took me an hour to figure out I could add 'stop propogation' to the element
that was causing the same state change to trigger twice. This was in the 
ListName / ListNameForm components.

7/6
Added success and error messages to add recipe to list feature on recipe show page.
Added apology text for ingredient filters with no recipes... is there a better way yo handle that???
